# web_dev_practice
A repo to put all of my html/CSS mini-projects which I use to practice my web-development skills. This is not one cohesive project, but many mini-projects, most which have been done through the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. I do not plan on turning these into real hosted websites, but am building up to building and hosting my own portfolio wesbite!
